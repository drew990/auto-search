## Description

I've been working on a project that allows users to input a VIN number and receive information about the car. Additionally, users can search for car listings in their area to find the perfect vehicle for them. The website is built on Next.js and coded in TypeScript, and it utilizes the Auto Dev API to provide accurate and up-to-date information.
